# MCP Setup

You are running the `spec:mcp-setup` workflow.

Before doing anything else, read `skills/mcp-setup/SKILL.md` and execute that workflow as the primary contract for this command.

Rules:
- Treat `skills/mcp-setup/SKILL.md` as the source of truth for phase execution, tool configuration, and verification behavior.
- This workflow installs and configures MCP tools needed for spec-first Full mode, using the active host's MCP config and marker paths.
- If `skills/mcp-setup/SKILL.md` is missing, stop and tell the user to run `spec-first init --codex`.
